# Global ATM
A script inspired by Infinite Warfare Zombies' ATM mechanic.

Share points amongst your team by depositing points by thousands in the machine and allow them to withdraw from another.
Best used to give a boost to players who respawn later rounds or players who join late-game.

## ATM Locations
Tranzit - Inside the bank
Town - Also inside the bank
Farm - Top floor of the barn near Double Tap
Bus Depot - In the fog to the right after leaving spawn, its also the pathing to Diner
Buried - Inside the bank
Die Rise - Far right room on the right side of Power
Mob of the Dead - In the spawn area
Origins - In the spawn area
Nuketown - Green House in the living room

## Installation
Download globalatm.gsc and put it in your Plutonium T6 scripts folder

```%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t6\scripts\zm\```

(if the folder isnt there create them)


OR you may use the source code/uncompiled version by using globalatm_sourcecode.gsc but if you don't know what youre doing in terms of GSC, I highly recommend you use the first choice
